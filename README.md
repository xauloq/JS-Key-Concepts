- **Code Snippets**: Practical examples that demonstrate how to implement each concept.
- **Dictionary**: A glossary at the end to clarify terms and enhance understanding.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Objects**: A collection of properties and methods.
2. **Properties**: Key-value pairs associated with objects.
3. **Methods**: Functions defined as properties of an object.
4. **Arrays**: Ordered lists of values.
5. **Functions**: Blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks.
6. **Variables**: Named containers used to store data.
7. **Loops**: Control structures that repeat a block of code.
8. **Conditionals**: Statements that execute different code based on conditions.
9. **Events**: Actions recognized by the program.
10. **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to other functions.
11. **Promises**: Objects representing the completion or failure of asynchronous operations.
12. **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects with predefined properties and methods.
13. **Scope**: The context in which variables are accessible.
14. **Closures**: Functions that remember their surrounding context.
15. **Arrow Functions**: Shorter syntax for writing functions.
16. **Template Literals**: String literals that allow embedded expressions.
17. **Destructuring**: Syntax for extracting values from arrays or properties from objects.
18. **Spread Operator**: Syntax for expanding iterables into individual elements.
19. **Rest Parameter**: Syntax for representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
20. **Import and Export (Modules)**: Sharing code between different files.
